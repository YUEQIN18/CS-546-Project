                    <p>Description: Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent
                        (singles)
                        or between two teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is
                        strung with
                        cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the
                        opponent's
                        court. The object of the game is to manoeuvre the ball in such a way that the opponent is not
                        able to
                        play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball validly will not gain a point,
                        while
                        the opposite player will.</p>

                        opposing
                        one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball
                        (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches
                        (46 cm)
                        in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court, while
                        preventing the
                        opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless
                        made from
                        behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the
                        player
                        fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws.
                        The
                        team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the
                        score
                        tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.</p>

                        sport
                        played with a spherical ball between two teams of 11 players. It is played by approximately 250

                        players in over 200 countries and dependencies, making it the world's most popular sport. The

                        played on a rectangular field called a pitch with a goal at each end. The objective of the game
                        is to
                        score more goals than the opposition by moving the ball beyond the goal line into the opposing
                        goal, usually

                        each,
                        that take turns batting and fielding. The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team,
                        called the
                        pitcher, throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat. The objective
                        of the
                        offensive team (batting team) is to hit the ball into the field of play, allowing its players to
                        run the bases,
                        having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called "runs". The
                        objective
                        of the defensive team (fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to
                        prevent runners'
                        advance around the bases.[2] A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in
                        order
                        and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter). The team that scores
                        the most runs
                        by the end of the game is the winner.</p>

                        flowing sequences, sometimes accompanied by breathing exercises, and frequently ending with

                        America and
                        Europe. It is derived from medieval Haá¹­ha yoga, which made use of similar postures, but it is
                        generally
                        simply called "yoga". Academics have given yoga as exercise a variety of names, including modern
